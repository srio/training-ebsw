# training-ebsw

The training session of ray-tracing for BM beamlines will mainly use ShadowOui, the new user interface to shadow3 using Oasys.

Two options are possible: 

- running ShadowOui in an ESRF computer (rnice8)
- installing it in the personal laptop

Installation instructions are at:

https://github.com/srio/oasys-installation-scripts/wiki

The files with documentation, workspaces and scripts are in this project repository, available inside the ESRF at the temporary area (T: or /tmp_14_days):
/tmp_14_days/srio/training-ebsw

It is suggested to install and copy the files to your computer before the training session. 

The use of the old interface ShadowVui is also possible, and installation files are at: /tmp_14_days/srio/XOP_INSTALLATION_FILES.

See you on Tuesday,

Manuel
